      <h1>Alaskan School System</h1>
      <h3>TIME PERIOD</h3>
	  <h4>Nicholas Mells</h4>
         <h3> Known for its peculiar territorial embeddedness; villages and rural areas are nestled within vast expanses of forest, with transportation between state and local governments consisting of maritime or aerial traffic. This geographical problem has augmented an already palpable theme many Native communities are challenged with. Isolation, cultural bias, and education that is not aligned with community. Producing a wildly inequitable situation for children growing up in Alaskan Natives. 
The myriad of problems is best articulated from the National Education Association, discussing the  complex issues facing community leaders and council; how to culturally and equitably engage in education practices that can benefit community. The National Education Association states:
“The contributions of AIANs[American Indians & Alaskan Natives] in American history and contemporary society have not been adequately recognized in public school curriculums. Too few students know, for instance, that the U.S. Constitution was developed in part upon concepts of democracy gained from the League of the Iroquois. Misconceptions about the "discovery of America by Columbus" do not recognize the pre-existence of sophisticated Indian nations. In addition, the "land bridge" theory of migration perpetuates the myth that all people immigrated to this continent. More needs to be taught about the value and importance of AIAN history and culture.”(NEA Education Issues 
&
“There is an increasing need for quality teachers in Indian schools. Due to rural isolation, low teacher salaries, high poverty, and differences in languages and cultures, it is difficult to recruit and retain quality teachers in Indian schools. Further, the need for special education teachers is growing since representation of AIAN students in special education is at 18 percent, almost double the rest of the student population at 10 percent.”(NEA Education Issues)

Within the confines of Alaska, this problem has begun to gain some traction within media and the state government. With inequitable treatment and low test scores the Governor Bill Walker & current Commissioner of Education Michael Johnson have commissioned a task force named Alaska’s Education Challenge tasked to target the states low achieving school systems and to establish better programs and initiatives to educate students. As the councils convened, a specific committee was established to target tribal communities in assessing the needs and policies that would best suit community. The Tribal  & Community Ownership subcommittee has set out its goals as:
“1. Tribal/Education Compacting: Allowing tribes and native organizations the option to enter into self-governance compacts with the State of Alaska to gain more autonomy in the
management and delivery of their education system.
2. Values: Allow and encourage regional areas to embed values in the education system.
Centering values around the place.
3. Partnerships – Strengthening relationships, expanding outreach, balancing power, with
various entities” (Alaskas Education Challenge Tribal & Community Ownership Minutes)
With this taskforce comes the opportunity to bury the paradox of self-determination juxtaposed with dependency on Western education systems imposed from colonialism. Through the funding of their own dollars, community engagement, and tribal compacting and partnerships an equitable alternative to the failing school system sanctioned by the government might be either reformed or dismantled all together pending a better alternative. Alaskan Natives, and most if not all indigenous communities, have been subjected to the brutalities of being forced to assimilate in a system that historically diminishes indigeneity and sovereignty. Decolonizing the mind comes from learning, not from a western educational perspective, but by the alternative models that were punished and banned for being alternatives to Western thought. To secure a spot for future generations of Native children the education system must be beneficial not only to them but must heal their community as well. Leanne Simpson the author of “As We Have Always Done: Indigenous Freedom Through Radical Resistance” thoughts on the essence of the resurgence of indigenous education relies on her nishnaabewin to understand a decolonized idea of education.
